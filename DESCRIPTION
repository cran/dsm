Description: Density surface modelling of line transect data. A Generalized
    Additive Model-based approach is used to calculate spatially-explicit estimates
    of animal abundance from distance sampling (also presence/absence and strip
    transect) data. Several utility functions are provided for model checking,
    plotting and variance estimation.
